    //A function has four parts:
    //1. name
    //2. Return type
    //3. Parameter list
    //4. Body
  
    //Lambdas are anonymous functions whose type is inferred. They have two things:
    // (parameter list) -> body


    // Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("In another thread"));
    
    
    //We can pass objects to functions
    //We can create objects within functions
    //We can return objects from functions.
    
    //Higher order functions:
    //We can pass functions to functions
    //We can create functions within functions
    //We can return functions from functions.
